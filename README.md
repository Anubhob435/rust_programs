# Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning folder! Here, I am starting my journey with the Rust programming language and its package manager, Cargo.

## What to Expect

- Multiple Rust files and projects as I explore the language.
- Experiments with Rust syntax, features, and best practices.
- Cargo project files and configuration examples.

## Why Rust?

Rust is known for its safety, speed, and concurrency. This folder documents my progress as I learn and build with Rust.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Rust and Cargo installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Use `cargo run` or `rustc` to compile and run the examples.

Stay tuned for more Rust code and experiments!
